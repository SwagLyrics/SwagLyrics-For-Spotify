        Fetches the currently playing song from Spotify on Windows and displays the lyrics in the command-line or in a browser tab.
        Refreshes automatically when song changes. The lyrics are fetched from Genius.
        Turns out Deezer already has this feature in-built but with `swaglyrics`, you can have it in Spotify as well.
        
        Probably wasn't thinking when I put _Swag_ in the name (will probably be seen
        by admission officers sigh) but I'm mainly trying to build this project as far as I can,
        for practice and to learn and work with more technologies (learnt AJAX).
        
        Initially developed this for personal use. Pretty much functionality oriented -- I usually develop something that I
        can see helping me and other users in the same situation.
        Packaged so I can first hand handle production-ready code to an extent and to make
        distribution and usage easier.

          SwagLyrics is participating in Google Code-in 2018 with CCExtractor Development!
        </p>
        
        Google Code-in is a global, online open source development & outreach contest for pre-university students aged between 13-17. Participants complete “tasks” ranging from coding, documentation, quality assurance, design, outreach and research to earn t-shirts, digital certificates, and hooded sweatshirts for their work. Grand Prize Winners receive a four day trip to Google in Mountain View, CA, USA the following summer!
        
        We have a long and proud history of taking part in the Google Summer of Code with university students, and are excited to participate in GCI again for 3rd year with pre-university students!

        ## Changelog
        - #### v0.1.9
        A GitHub issue is created automatically on the repo when an unsupported song is encountered (implemented server-side using pythonanywhere).
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install swaglyrics
        ```
        Make sure to use a version >= 0.1.6 since the previous ones don't have the `tab` option supported.
        
        ## Usage
        `swaglyrics [-h] [-t] [-c]`
        
        Either the tab or cli argument is required to output lyrics.
        
        Arguments:
        ```
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          -t, --tab   Display lyrics in a browser tab.
          -c, --cli   Display lyrics in the command-line.
        ```
        
        ## Package Structure
        ```
        .
        |-- swaglyrics
            |-- static  # contains styling and the AJAX script needed to dynamically refresh browser tab with new lyrics
            |-- templates  # contains template for the browser tab
            |-- __init__.py
            |-- __main__.py  # holds primary function that parses args and executes accordingly
            |-- cli.py  # defines functions to fetch lyrics from Genius
            |-- spotify.py  # defines functions to get currently playing song and artist from the Spotify app
            |-- tab.py  # Flask app to display lyrics in a browser tab
            |-- tests.py    # need overhauling
            |-- unsupported.txt  # to log unsupported songs, will be updated soon
        |-- LICENSE.md
        |-- MANIFEST.in
        |-- README.md
        |-- setup.py
        ```
        
        ## Improvements Planned
        1. MacOS support
        2. ~~Better logging of unsupported songs, the isolated unsupported.txt is sub-optimal for multiple users since the
        file will only update locally with songs which worked fine when it was just me but since I hope others use it too, I'll
        try to add a better method with server support.~~
        3. Better tests to test all of the functionality.
        4. Perhaps a tiny app using Electron that could fit in your tray to be opened whenever you want lyrics for a song.
        5. Supporting more songs, currently the program sometimes fails at remixes since while the lyrics are same as original,
         the artist is the remixer.
        6. Documenting all the files.
