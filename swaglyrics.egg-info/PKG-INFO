        Fetches the currently playing song from Spotify and displays the lyrics from Genius on cmd.
        
        Made this mainly for personal use so that I don't sing along with wrong lyrics and end up embarrassing myself later.
        
        
        Probably wasn't thinking when I put _Swag_ in the name (Imagine if this project ends on my CV) but 
        I'm mainly trying to build this project as far as I can, mainly for practice and to learn stuff.
        
        Main priorities are supporting more songs and making it faster and better. 
        Hopefully an API too so you can get lyrics from wherever.
