Fetches the currently playing song from Spotify on Windows, Linux and macOS and displays the lyrics in the command-line or in a browser tab.
Refreshes automatically when song changes. The lyrics are fetched from Genius.
Turns out Deezer already has this feature in-built but with `swaglyrics`, you can have it in Spotify as well.

I'm mainly trying to build this project as far as I can,
for practice and to learn and work with more technologies and platforms.

Initially developed this for personal use. Pretty much functionality oriented -- I usually develop something that I
can see helping me and other users in the same situation.
Packaged so I can first hand handle production-ready code to an extent and to make
distribution and usage easier.

## Community
- SwagLyrics participated in [Google Code-in 2018](https://g.co/gci) with CCExtractor Development.
- SwagLyrics is participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://g.co/gsoc) with CCExtractor Development. Interested? Read more about it [here](https://www.ccextractor.org/public:gsoc:swaglyrics).

## Installation
Requires Python3. Use pip or pip3 depending on your installation.
```
pip install swaglyrics
```
Make sure to use a version >= 0.1.6 since the previous ones don't have the `tab` option supported.

## Usage
`swaglyrics [-h] [-t] [-c]`

Either the tab or cli argument is required to output lyrics.

Arguments:
```
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -t, --tab   Display lyrics in a browser tab.
  -c, --cli   Display lyrics in the command-line.
```
You can quit by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>

## Compiling SwagLyrics for Development

- Clone the repo by `git clone https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify.git` or use ssh.
- `cd` into the cloned repo.
- `pip install -e .` the -e flag installs it locally in editable mode.

## Improvements Planned
1. ~~Linux and macOS support **done**~~
2. ~~Better logging of unsupported songs, the isolated unsupported.txt is sub-optimal for multiple users since the
file will only update locally with songs which worked fine when it was just me but since I hope others use it too, I'll
try to add a better method with server support.~~
3. Better tests to test all of the functionality.
4. Perhaps a tiny app using Electron that could fit in your tray to be opened whenever you want lyrics for a song.
5. Supporting more songs, currently the program sometimes fails at remixes since while the lyrics are same as original,
 the artist is the remixer.
6. Documenting all the files.
