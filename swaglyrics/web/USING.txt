Given Genius will be accessed by you when the get_lyrics function of SwagLyrics is called, you must comply by their
Terms of Use (https://genius.com/static/terms) if your use of SwagLyrics calls that function.

They say that you should be authorized in writing by Genius except if it's content you legally uploaded there.
You should check out their official terms that I linked above to read the official document :)
