# Contributors Guide

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Etiquette

This project is open source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the source code held within. They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers. It would be extremely unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.

Please be considerate towards maintainers when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's show the world that developers are civilized and selfless people.

It's the duty of the maintainer to ensure that all submissions to the project are of sufficient quality to benefit the project. Many developers have different skillsets, strengths, and weaknesses. Respect the maintainer's decision, and do not be upset or abusive if your submission is not used.

## Viability

When requesting or submitting new features, first consider whether it might be useful to others. Open source projects are used by many developers, who may have entirely different needs to your own. Think about whether or not your feature is likely to be used by other users of the project.

## Procedure

Before filing an issue:

- Attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.
- Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.

Before submitting a pull request:

- Ensure that your submission is [viable](#viability) for the project.
- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.
- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.

## Requirements for a pull request

- Please make sure you conform to the [PEP-8 coding guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code
- For docstrings, please adhere to [PEP-257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
- For typing, please adhere to [PEP-484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)

A code checker for PEP-8 has been enabled. It is recommended to check your code before making a PR, and it's likewise recommended to use an IDE to check your code ([PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) offers a free community edition, and has student licenses as well!)
