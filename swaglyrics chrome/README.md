Spotify Chrome Notifications
============================

This is a Google Chrome extension that notifies you every time your Spotify Web Player plays a new song. Just something I built quickly to see how the webnotifications API works.

###Installation

I'll cover both techniques here because installing extensions *crx* files from outside the Chrome Web Store is not allowed anymore.

#####Unpacked:

1. Download/clone this repo to your machine
2. Open chrome://extensions and click `Load unpacked extension...`
3. Browse to the downloaded folder and click `Select`

#####Packed:

1. Download the file `spotify-chrome-notifications.crx` from this repo
2. Open chrome://extensions and drag-and-drop the downloaded *crx* file

###Usage

Once the extension is installed, head over to http://play.spotify.com, and start listening! You will start seeing notifications popup each time you change a track.
